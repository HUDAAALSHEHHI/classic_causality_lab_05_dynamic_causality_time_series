üß† Comprehensive Explanation

This experiment explores the boundaries of causality in dynamic systems, where relationships evolve over time instead of remaining static. The goal is to understand how temporal dependencies and feedback loops influence the direction and strength of causal effects. By simulating time-series data where one variable influences another with a time delay, the experiment demonstrates how Granger causality can detect such relationships in dynamic environments.

‚úèÔ∏è Objective

To demonstrate how causal inference can be extended to time-dependent systems, allowing researchers to identify whether past values of one variable can predict future values of another. The experiment aims to deepen understanding of dynamic causality where influence unfolds over time and highlight the importance of temporal modeling in complex systems such as economics, climate, and neuroscience.

üìò Results

The experiment found evidence of dynamic causality between the two variables: past values of X significantly improved prediction of Y. This confirms that causality can vary with time, revealing relationships that would remain hidden in static analyses. The result validates the use of Granger causality tests as a powerful method for detecting directionality in time-series data.

üìó Notes

The dataset was synthetically generated to include a known lagged causal relationship between X and Y.

Granger testing confirmed that the cause precedes the effect with measurable statistical significance.

Dynamic systems often exhibit context-dependent causality, meaning influence changes under different temporal conditions.

Researchers should interpret causality cautiously when feedback loops or delayed effects exist.

This workflow can be extended using vector autoregression (VAR) or Bayesian dynamic models for multi-variable causal discovery.
